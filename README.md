# Automated-Street-Lighting-Using-IOT
➢ Needs no manual operation for switching ON and OFF. When there is a need of light it automatically switches ON. When darkness rises to a certain level then sensor circuit gets activated and switches ON and when there is other source of light i.e. daytime, the street light gets OFF. The sensitiveness of the street light can also be adjusted. In our project we have used six LEDs as a symbol of street lamp, and for high power switching we have connected Relay (electromagnetic switch). ➢ The output has only two states high and low and cannot remain in any intermediate stage. It is powered by an AC source. ➢ LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is a special type of resistor whose value depends on the brightness of the light which is falling on it. It has resistance of about 1 mega ohm when in total darkness, but a resistance of only about 5k ohms when brightness illuminated. It responds to a large part of light spectrum. Since, voltage is directly proportional to conductance so more voltage we will get from this divider when LDR is getting light and low voltage in darkness.
